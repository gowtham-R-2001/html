<b>Tamil Nadu </b>, a South Indian state, is famed for its <i>Dravidian-style Hindu temples</i>. <br />
In Madurai, Meenakshi Amman Temple has high <u>‘gopuram’</u> towers ornamented with colourful figures.<br />
On Pamban Island, Ramanathaswamy Temple is a pilgrimage site.<br />
The town of Kanyakumari, at India’s southernmost tip, is the site of ritual sunrises. <br />
Capital <b>Chennai</b> is known for beaches and landmarks including 1644 colonial Fort St. George.<br /><br />
<b>Prehistory</b><br /><br />
Archaeological evidence points to this area being one of the longest continuous habitations <br />
in the Indian peninsula. In Attirampakkam, archaeologists from the Sharma Centre for Heritage <br />
Education excavated ancient stone tools which suggests that a humanlike population existed in the Tamil <br />
Nadu region somewhere around 1,000 years before homo sapiens arrived from Africa. In Adichanallur, <br />
24 km (15 mi) from Tirunelveli, archaeologists from the Archaeological Survey of India (ASI) unearthed 169 clay <br />
urns containing human skulls, skeletons, bones, husks, grains of rice, charred rice and celts of the <br />
Neolithic period, 3,800 years ago. The ASI archaeologists have proposed that the script used at<br />
that site is "very rudimentary" Tamil Brahmi. Adichanallur has been announced as an archaeological site <br />
for further excavation and studies. About 60 per cent of the total epigraphical inscriptions found by the <br />
ASI in India are from Tamil Nadu, and most of these are in the Tamil language <br />

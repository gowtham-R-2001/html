Syzygium luehmannii is a medium-sized coastal rainforest tree native to Australia. Common names include <span class="clr"><u>riberry</u></span>, small leaved lilly pilly, cherry satinash,  
cherry alder, or clove lilli pilli.  
The habitat is Australian riverine, littoral, subtropical or tropical rainforest. It grows on volcanic soils or deep sandy soils between the 
Macleay River in New South Wales to near Cairns in tropical Queensland. It is commonly grown as an ornamental tree and for its fruit, known as a riberry. 
Occasionally reaching 30 metres in height and 90 cm in trunk diameter, the tree's crown is dense with small leaves, above a tall straight trunk.  
Large trees are buttressed at the base. The bark is red brown, light grey or pinkish grey with soft papery scales.  
The small, glossy, lance-shaped leaves are a shiny green when mature, but pink/red when young. They are opposite, simple, entire, lanceolate to ovate, 4 to 5 cm long, 
 drawn out to a long prominent point. The leaf stalks are 2 to 3 mm long.  
Flowers form in November or December. They are in small panicles at the ends of branchlets, half the length of the leaves or less.  
The white or cream petals form in fours or fives, 1.5 mm long. The stamina are 2 to 5 mm long.

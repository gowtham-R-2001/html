Ugli Fruit also known by proprietary names ugli /ˈʌɡli/ fruit, uglifruit, and uniq fruit, is a citrus fruit that  
arose on the island of Jamaica through the natural hybridization of a tangerine or orange with a grapefruit (or pomelo),  
and is thus a tangelo. The original tree is believed to have been a hybrid formed from the Seville orange, the grapefruit  
and the tangerine families. 
As a hybrid species, it is usually represented as Citrus reticulata × paradisi. 
This tangelo was a natural hybrid, having arisen spontaneously like the grapefruit, in Jamaica, where it is mainly 
grown today. <span class="clr"><u>'UGLI'</u></span> is a registered trademark of Cabel Hall Citrus Limited, under which it markets the fruit, 
the name being a variation of the word "ugly", which refers to the fruit's unsightly appearance, with rough, wrinkled, 
greenish-yellow rind, wrapped loosely around the orange pulpy citrus inside.

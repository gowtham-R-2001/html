The <span class="clr"><u>orange</u></span> is the fruit of various citrus species in the family Rutaceae (see list of plants known as orange) <br />
it primarily refers to Citrus × sinensis,which is also called sweet orange, to distinguish it from the related <br />
Citrus × aurantium, referred to as bitter orange. The sweet orange reproduces asexually (apomixis through nucellar <br />
embryony); varieties of sweet orange arise through mutations.<br />
The orange is a hybrid between pomelo (Citrus maxima) and mandarin (Citrus reticulata).<br />
 The chloroplast genome, and therefore the maternal line, is that of pomelo. The sweet orange has had its full<br />
 genome sequenced.<br />
The orange originated in a region comprising Southern China, Northeast India, and Myanmar,<br /> and the earliest mention of the 
sweet orange was in Chinese literature in 314 BC. As of 1987, orange trees were found to be the most cultivated fruit tree in<br />
 the world.[10] Orange trees are widely grown in tropical and subtropical climates for their sweet fruit. The fruit of the<br />
 orange tree can be eaten fresh, or processed for its juice or fragrant peel. As of 2012, sweet oranges accounted for <br />
 approximately 70% of citrus production.<br />
In 2017, 73 million tonnes of oranges were grown worldwide, with Brazil producing 24% of the world total,<br /> followed by China and India

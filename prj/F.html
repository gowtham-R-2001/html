Ficus carica

Ficus carica is an Asian species of flowering plant in the mulberry family,  
known as the <span class="clr"><u>common fig</u></span> (or just the fig). It is the source of the fruit also called the fig and  
as such is an important crop in those areas where it is grown commercially. Native to the Middle East 
and western Asia, it has been sought out and cultivated since ancient times and is now widely grown  
throughout the world, both for its fruit and as an ornamental plant.
The species has become naturalized in scattered locations in Asia and North America.

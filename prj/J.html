The <span class="clr"><u>jackfruit</u></span> (Artocarpus heterophyllus), also known as jack tree,is a species of tree in the fig,  
mulberry, and breadfruit family (Moraceae). Its origin is in the region between the Western Ghats of  
southern India and the rainforests of Malaysia. 
The jack tree is well-suited to tropical lowlands, and is widely cultivated throughout tropical regions of the world. 
It bears the largest fruit of all trees, reaching as much as 55 kg (120 pounds) in weight, 90 cm (35 inches) in length, 
and 50 cm (20 inches) in diameter. A mature jack tree produces some 200 fruits per year, with  
older trees bearing up to 500 fruits in a year. The jackfruit is a multiple fruit  
composed of hundreds to thousands of individual flowers, and the fleshy petals of the unripe fruit are eaten. 
The ripe fruit is sweet (depending on variety) and is more often used for desserts. Canned jackfruit has a mild taste  
and meat-like texture that lends itself to being called a "vegetable meat". 
Jackfruit is commonly used in South and Southeast Asian cuisines. Both ripe and unripe fruits are consumed. 
The jackfruit is the national fruit of Bangladesh and Sri Lanka, and the state fruit of the Indian states of Kerala 
and Tamil Nadu. It is available internationally canned or frozen and in chilled meals as are various products  
derived from the fruit such as noodles and chips.

The <span class="red bd">apple</span> is a deciduous tree, generally standing 2 to 4.5 m (6 to 15 ft) tall in cultivation and up to 9 m (30 ft) in the wild.
When cultivated, the size, shape and branch density are determined by rootstock selection and trimming method.
The leaves are alternately arranged dark green-colored simple ovals with serrated margins and slightly downy undersides.
<span>Apple</span> blossom Blossoms are produced in spring simultaneously with the budding of the leaves and are
produced on spurs and some long shoots. The 3 to 4 cm (1 to 11⁄2 in) flowers are white with a pink
tinge that gradually fades, five petaled, with an inflorescence consisting of a cyme with 4–6 flowers.
The central flower of the inflorescence is called the "king bloom"; it opens first and can develop a larger fruit. The fruit matures in late summer or autumn, and cultivars exist in a wide range of sizes.
Commercial growers aim to produce an apple that is 7 to 8.5 cm (23⁄4 to 3 1⁄4 in) in diameter, due to market preference. Some consumers, especially those in Japan, prefer a larger apple,
while apples below 5.5 cm (21⁄4 in) are generally used for making juice and have little fresh market value.
<a href="imgs.html">The skin of ripe apples</a> is generally red, yellow, green, pink, or russetted, though many bi- or tri-colored
cultivars may be found. The skin may also be wholly or partly russeted i.e. rough and brown. The skin is covered in a protective layer of epicuticular wax.
The exocarp (flesh) is generally pale yellowish-whit ,though pink or yellow exocarps also occur.</p>
